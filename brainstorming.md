# App Ideas

## Austin
### AI Fitness Tracker
A workout tracker that lets users track their exercises and ask AI to create a workout plan for them.
### AI Travel Buddy
An app that builds personalized vacation itineraries based on user preferences, location, and trip length. It dynamically suggests activities, dining, and logistics while adapting to changes like weather or time constraints. The goal is to make trip planning feel conversational, intuitive, and stress-free.
### AI Dream Journal
A typical dream journal with a twist. This app allows users to describe and log dreams into the journal and AI will create a picture based off the dream.

### Movie Recommendation System

AI Movie recommendation system. You enter in types of movie genres you like and the system returns at least 3 movie recommendations. Genres like: horror, mystery, and thriller. Returns: haunted house, slasher, and IT.

### Fish Hook Mobile Game

A fisherman is on a canoe and the goal is to collect 20 specific fish from different lakes and collect them within 4 minutes. There are up to 50 levels, where the difficulty gets harder with obstacles like gators, enemy canoes, and explosives. As you gain those fish you earn up to 10 points per fish and there are bonus rare fish which earn you 30 points.

### ***PumpMix***
An app that tracks what music you're listening to throughout the day and matches it with your mood and what you're doing. Over time the AI figures out patterns and can suggest playlists that help you focus, relax, or get pumped based on what's worked for you before.

### ***PicChef***
Take a pic of what's in your fridge and the AI tells you what macro friendly meals you can cook with it. You can filter by dietary needs, type of food, and how long it takes. Helps you use up food before it goes bad since some of us can be terrible at that.

### ***Habit Garden***
A virtual garden where each plant is a habit you're trying to build (working out, tracking meals, etc.). Plants grow when you do the task and die if you skip it. Friends can visit your garden and send boosts, and there's leaderboards to compete. Makes tracking habits more fun and visual instead of just a checklist.

### Neatify - A Study Helper
This application would use AI to get students messy notes (handwritten, typed, etc) from a PDF and make it more neatly formatted. Would be very helpful for students with messy handwriting and/or who have a hard time writing notes down in a neat way.
### EZQuiz - Quiz Maker
This would take in any PDF the user sends and turns it into a quiz using AI. The user can change the attributes of this quiz such as quantity of questions, type of question, and an optional time limit.
### WakeUp! - Alarm
This would function as a normal alarm, but would then ask the user to complete some sort of puzzle (scanning a certain object, do a math problem, or take a picture of them stood up) in order to stop the alarm. This alarm would snooze up to 3 times, but each snooze would make the task harder and harder each time.

### GuessThatPic - AI Image Guessing Game
The game shows a blurred or cropped image. Players guess what’s in it — dog, pizza, Eiffel Tower? The incorporation of AI would be to tag the photos and validate the users guesses.

### SleepSync – AI Sleep Habit Tracker
Users can log their sleep times and habits. The app would use AI to give users feedback and tips on how to improve their sleep quality (eg. sleeping earlier, relaxing music to calm the mind, and etc ). 

### Calender-Con Convention tracker app
The function of this app is to track conventions that the user may desire to attend. The AI would be used to reccomend conventions that may interest the user, where it is located, and keep track of how long before the convention begins. 

## Olamide

### Study Buddy
An app that helps students keep track of assignments that they input and help create a study/work schedule to help reduce procrastination. Would adapt to users through different study methods like pomodoro and such
### Traveller's translations
This app would be a simple app that helps vacation goers or people traveling to foreign countries in learning the basics of communication in those countries. The app would be a compendium of common useful phrases and descriptions of customs in target country, and provide recommendations of activities and places to visit in local cities.

## Overview

### Description

Fitelligence elevates the standard workout log by placing a personal AI trainer right inside your tracking app. Instead of following static, pre-made plans, users can instantly generate a workout by simply typing a request in plain language. You can command the AI to create a session tailored to specific criteria and receive a complete, personalized routine instantly. This dynamic tool saves time, reduces decision fatigue, and ensures your training evolves precisely to match your goals, available equipment, and daily energy levels. Itâ€™s the ultimate solution for taking the guesswork out of effective, adaptive strength training.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Health & Fitness
- **Mobile:** This app is inherently mobile. Users will use their phone to easily track their exercises. Can also utilize push notifications for workout reminders and/or integrate with smartwatches.
- **Story:**  A personal trainer in your pocket. Can help users who struggle to plan their workouts accordingly, or just save time by already having a personalized plan.
- **Market:**  Those who are or are getting into fitness.
- **Habit:**  High potential for near daily use as this app plans to be the go-to fitness app.
- **Scope:** The scope of this app is defintely challenging. While the core features of a workout tracker are manageable, incorporating AI in a way that the app can consistely and reliably use may prove difficult.
